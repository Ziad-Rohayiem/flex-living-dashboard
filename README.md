# Flex Living Reviews Dashboard - Technical Documentation

ðŸ”— **Live Demo**: https://flex-living-dashboard-3xbs.vercel.app/properties

## 1. Project Overview

The Flex Living Reviews Dashboard is a comprehensive review management system that enables property managers to curate and publish guest reviews for their premium properties. The system integrates with the Hostaway Reviews API (mocked) and provides both manager-facing and guest-facing interfaces.

## 2. Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **Next.js 15** (App Router) - React framework with server-side rendering
- **React 18** - UI component library
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **Lucide React** - Icon library

### Backend
- **Next.js API Routes** - Serverless functions for API endpoints
- **Local Storage** - Persistence layer for published reviews (demo purposes)

### Development Tools
- **ESLint** - Code linting
- **TypeScript** (optional) - Type safety

## 3. Architecture & Design Decisions

### 3.1 Component Architecture
```
app/
â”œâ”€â”€ api/reviews/hostaway/    # API endpoint for review data
â”œâ”€â”€ components/              # Reusable UI components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Dashboard.js        # Manager dashboard
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ReviewCard.js       # Modular review display
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Navigation.js       # App-wide navigation
â”œâ”€â”€ dashboard/              # Manager dashboard route
â”œâ”€â”€ properties/             # Public property listing
â”œâ”€â”€ property/[id]/          # Individual property pages
â””â”€â”€ utils/                  # Helper functions
```

### 3.2 Key Design Decisions

**1. Mock API Integration**
- Created realistic API responses matching Hostaway structure
- Normalized review data for consistent frontend consumption
- Added property ID mapping for reliable navigation

**2. Modular Review Display**
- ReviewCard component with multiple display variants (table/card)
- Reusable across dashboard and property pages
- Consistent styling and behavior

**3. Persistent Review Publishing**
- LocalStorage for demo (easily replaceable with database)
- Reviews remain published across sessions
- Manager can update selections anytime

**4. Role-Based Access**
- Simple localStorage-based authentication for demo
- Separate navigation for managers vs. guests
- Protected dashboard routes

## 4. API Behaviors

### GET /api/reviews/hostaway

**Purpose**: Fetches and normalizes review data

**Response Structure**:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "result": [
    {
      "id": 7453,
      "type": "guest-to-host",
      "status": "published",
      "rating": 8,
      "publicReview": "Great stay!",
      "categories": [...],
      "propertyId": 848961949,
      "guestName": "John Doe",
      "listingName": "2B N1 A - Shoreditch",
      "channel": "Airbnb",
      "isSelected": false
    }
  ]
}
```

**Data Transformations**:
- Calculates average ratings from category ratings
- Maps property names to consistent IDs
- Normalizes channel data
- Converts ratings to 5-star scale for display ( still buggy *_^ )

## 5. Feature Implementation

### 5.1 Manager Dashboard Features

**Property Performance**
- Displays review counts and average ratings per property
- Visual hierarchy for easy scanning
- Search functionality for large property lists

**Filtering & Sorting**
- Multi-criteria filtering: property, rating, channel, date range
- Bidirectional sorting: date, rating
- Real-time filter updates
- Persistent filter states during session

**Trend Analysis**
- Identifies recurring issues from low-rated reviews
- Keyword extraction from review text
- Category performance tracking

**Review Publishing**
- Checkbox selection with visual feedback
- Bulk publish/unpublish operations
- Published status indicators
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

### 5.2 Guest-Facing Features

**Property Browsing**
- Responsive grid layout
- Filtering (price, guests, type)
- Search by location or property name
- Sort by price, rating, or featured

**Property Details**
- Flex Living branded design (alittle bit poor due to time constraints)
- Only shows manager-approved reviews
- Guest-to-host reviews only (relevant content)
- Rating display converted to 5-star scale ( Also still buggy *_* )

## 6. Google Reviews Integration (Exploration)

### Findings:
Google Places API can provide review data through:
- **Places Details** endpoint
- Requires API key and Place ID
- Returns maximum 5 most relevant reviews
- Real-time data but limited quantity

### Implementation Considerations(challenges):
- **Cost**: Pay-per-request pricing model
- **Rate Limits**: Quotas on API calls
- **Data Limitations**: Only 5 reviews, no historical data
- **Authentication**: Requires Google Cloud setup
- **Place ID Mapping**: Each Flex Living property must be mapped to corresponding Google Place ID
- **Limited Business Profiles**: Short-term rental properties often lack established Google Business listings or have inconsistent presence
- **Data Inconsistency**: Property names in Google may not match internal Flex Living naming conventions
- **Review Attribution**: Difficulty in matching Google reviews to specific booking periods or guest stays

### Alternative Approaches Considered
- **1. Web Scraping**
**Pros**: Could potentially access full review data
**Cons**: Legally risky ðŸ˜” 

- **2. Manual Data Entry**
**Pros**: Simple
**Cons**: Time-consuming, prone to errors, and not scalable


### Recommendation:
1. Primary reviews from Hostaway (comprehensive)
2. Google Reviews integration should be considered as a future enhancement once:
- Core dashboard is stable and proven valuable
- Property-to-Place ID mapping is established
- Caching Google data to minimize API costs is implemented

## 7. Setup Instructions
